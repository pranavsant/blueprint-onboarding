            This past weekend, I taught at Mission Bit. I was working with a
            group of high school students who were building their first web
            pages. I really enjoyed being able to help guide 10 students on
            learning CS fundamentals through a project! They were all really
            eager to learn, and I&#39;m glad I signed up. Highly recommend to
            any other software engineers interested in volunteering! Sign-up
            here: https://missionbit.org/get-involved/volunteer-with-us/
